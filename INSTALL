To build in Windows using Visual Studio 2010 (other versions not tested):
  In the source directory, make new directory called "references"
  Copy library directories [SDL-1.2.15 and SDL_image-1.2.12 (higher versions 
    should be fine too) ] to references directory
  Build sln in Visual Studio

  For distribution, build Release version, then copy library DLLs and images to
  the same directory as the EXE file.

To build in Linux:
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev
  make

To build deb package:
  Ensure files in debian directory are correct (esp. control, spacepirates.dirs)

  start in the main source directory named [directoryName]
  cd ..
  (in the following command, replace 1.0 with the proper version number)
  tar czfv spacepirates_1.0.orig.tar.gz [directoryName]
  cd [directoryName]
  (in the following, replace 1.0-1 with [mainVersion]-[packageVersion])
  dch --create -v 1.0-1 --package spacepirates
  (now ensure debian/changelog values are correct)
  debuild -us -uc
  cd ..
  (you should see deb package here)

  *** Version number explanation from wiki.debian.org/IntroDebianPackaging
    The ["spacepirates"] part MUST be the same as the source package name. 1.0-1
    is the version. The 1.0 part is the upstream version. The -1 part is the 
    Debian version: the first version of the Debian package of upstream version
    1.0. If the Debian package has a bug, and it gets fixed, but the upstream 
    version remains the same, then the next version of the package will be 
    called 1.0-2. Then 1.0-3, and so on.
